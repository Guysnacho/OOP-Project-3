Errors
Round with 3 players, only 2 active players present. I think 2 black jacks and 1 calamity janet.
Maybe Both Black Jacks were treated as 1?

Indian attack but no one took damage
FIX - Added a print statement to prompt the user

No prompt when calamity janet died. Sheriff won. Win conditions working
FIX - Adding a prompt at the start of every round showing living players
